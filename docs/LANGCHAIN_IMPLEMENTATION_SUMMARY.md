### Task 19.3: Update API endpoints for LangChain integration ✅

**What was implemented:**
- Created new LangChain-specific endpoints for lesson generation with full pipeline integration
- Added pipeline status tracking and management endpoints
- Implemented curriculum and lesson plan access endpoints
- Added proper validation, security, and subscription checks
- Created comprehensive test coverage for all new API endpoints

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /lessons/generate-langchain` - Start LangChain pipeline
- `GET /lessons/pipeline-status/{pipeline_id}` - Get pipeline progress
- `GET /curriculum` - Get generated curriculum scheme
- `GET /lesson-plans` - Get generated lesson plans
- `GET /lessons/{lesson_id}/langchain` - Get LangChain-generated lesson content
- `POST /lessons/pipeline-cancel/{pipeline_id}` - Cancel running pipeline

**Key Features:**
- Full backward compatibility with existing lesson endpoints
- Real-time pipeline progress monitoring
- Secure access control with user verification
- Subscription-based access control
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/api/lessons.py` - Added new LangChain endpoints
- `backend/tests/test_lessons_langchain_api.py` - New comprehensive test suite

```

### Key Components

1. **LangChain Chains**: Specialized AI chains for each generation stage
2. **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Manages the complete workflow with progress tracking
3. **User Data Service**: Handles data persistence and retrieval
4. **RAG Document System**: Provides context and guidelines for AI generation
5. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for client interaction

## Technical Specifications

### AI Model Integration
- **Model**: xAI Grok-3 Mini
- **API**: xAI API v1
- **Framework**: LangChain with custom chains
- **Temperature**: Optimized per stage (0.8 for surveys, 0.7 for curriculum/lessons, 0.6 for content)
- **Max Tokens**: Scaled per stage (2000-4000 tokens)

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: User survey responses and skill assessment
2. **Processing**: Three-stage AI pipeline with RAG document integration
3. **Output**: Personalized curriculum, lesson plans, and complete lesson content
