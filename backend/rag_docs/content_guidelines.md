# Content Guidelines for Lesson Generation

## Lesson Structure Template

Every lesson should follow this structure:

### 1. Introduction (5-10% of content)
- Brief overview of the topic
- Connection to previous lessons
- Learning objectives (2-4 specific, measurable goals)

### 2. Core Concepts (40-50% of content)
- Clear explanations with analogies when helpful
- Step-by-step breakdowns of complex topics
- Visual representations when applicable

### 3. Code Examples (25-30% of content)
- Minimum 2 practical examples per lesson
- Examples should progress from simple to complex
- Include comments explaining key concepts
- Show both correct usage and common mistakes

### 4. Hands-on Exercises (15-20% of content)
- 3-5 exercises of varying difficulty
- Include starter code when appropriate
- Provide clear instructions and expected outcomes
- Mix of guided practice and independent challenges

### 5. Summary and Next Steps (5% of content)
- Key takeaways recap
- Preview of next lesson
- Additional resources for deeper learning

## Code Example Quality Standards

### Example Requirements
- **Relevance**: Examples must directly relate to the lesson topic
- **Clarity**: Code should be well-commented and easy to understand
- **Completeness**: Examples should be runnable without additional setup
- **Progression**: Start simple, build complexity gradually

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for Python, 2 for JavaScript)
- Include meaningful variable and function names
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Follow language-specific best practices

### Example Format
```
## Example 1: [Descriptive Title]

[Brief explanation of what this example demonstrates]

```[language]
# Comments explaining the code
code_here = "with proper formatting"
```

**Output:**
```
Expected output here
```

**Explanation:**
[Detailed explanation of how the code works and why it's important]
```

## Exercise Design Principles

### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: Direct application of concepts shown in examples
- **Intermediate**: Requires combining multiple concepts or slight modification
- **Advanced**: Requires creative problem-solving and deeper understanding

### Exercise Format
```
### Exercise [Number]: [Title] (Difficulty: [Level])

**Objective:** [What the student should accomplish]

**Instructions:**
1. [Step-by-step instructions]
2. [Clear, actionable tasks]

**Starter Code:** (if applicable)
```[language]
# Provided starting point
```

**Expected Outcome:** [What the solution should achieve]

**Hints:** (for more challenging exercises)
- [Helpful guidance without giving away the solution]
```

## Content Quality Standards

### Accuracy
- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Technical explanations must be precise and up-to-date
- No deprecated methods or outdated practices

### Accessibility
- Use clear, simple language appropriate for the skill level
- Provide multiple ways to understand concepts (text, code, analogies)
- Include alternative approaches when relevant

### Engagement
- Use real-world examples and scenarios
- Include interactive elements and hands-on practice
- Vary content presentation to maintain interest

### Assessment Integration
- Each lesson should build toward measurable learning outcomes
- Include self-check questions throughout
- Provide clear success criteria for exercises

## Markdown Formatting Standards

### Headers
- Use `#` for lesson title
- Use `##` for major sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use `####` for exercise titles

### Code Blocks
- Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- Use inline code `like this` for short snippets
- Use fenced code blocks for longer examples

### Lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items
- Maintain consistent indentation

### Emphasis
- Use **bold** for important terms and concepts
- Use *italics* for emphasis and variable names
- Use `code formatting` for technical terms and file names
