# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Universal Subject Access feature simplifies the MindCoach application by removing the subscription model entirely and providing free access to all subjects including therapy. This enhancement eliminates all subscription-based restrictions and payment requirements, making the application a proof of concept that allows users to freely explore and access all learning content across any subject.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the subject system to automatically include new subjects, so that content expansion doesn't require manual interface updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SubjectSelector component loads THEN it SHALL fetch all subjects from the /api/subjects endpoint
2. WHEN processing the API response THEN the system SHALL display all returned subjects without any filtering
3. WHEN rendering subjects THEN the system SHALL apply consistent styling to all subjects
4. WHEN the API returns subject data THEN the system SHALL treat all subjects as fully accessible
5. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully display available subjects or appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all subscription-related code and database dependencies, so that the application becomes a simple proof of concept without payment complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the backend processes subject requests THEN the system SHALL remove all subscription validation logic
3. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL not require subscription-related tables or queries
4. WHEN users interact with any subject THEN the system SHALL proceed directly to content generation
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL function without any payment or subscription infrastructure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want a clean and accessible subject selection interface, so that I can navigate and select subjects regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
